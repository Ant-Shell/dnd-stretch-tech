draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his
people's elk herd.
A half-ore snarls at the latest challenger to her
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
elbow into the gut of another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and
unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger
is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting
assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
For some, their rage springs from a communion
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
feats of strength.`], ['Bard', `Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient
monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged
leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind,
conjured forth by the magic of her song-knowledge
of the people who constructed the monument and the
mythic saga it depicts.
A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically
against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant
and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism.
The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.
Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves
her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring
that her companions' words will be well received.
Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves
magic through words and music to inspire allies,
demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create
illusions, and even heal wounds. `], ['Cleric', `Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer
on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that
spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.
Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe
in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of ores
arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with
every foe's fall.
Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a
human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to
drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.
Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods
they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
divine magic. `], ['Druid', `Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf
summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive
bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying ores who
threaten her forest.
Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the
form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the
strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air,
keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.
Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf
charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering
the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the
mocking semblance of life.
Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or
emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are
an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury.
They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see
themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.`], ['Fighter', `A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield
before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite
bow. The half-ore nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the
best advantage.
A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between
the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly
blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,
swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
them around for the crowd's delight-and his own
tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with
blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing
forth to smite him.
All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most
diverse class of characters in the worlds of DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
and bandit kings-as fighters, they all share an
unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and
staring it defiantly in the face.`], ['Monk', `Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows,
a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself
into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side.
She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and
sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.
Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos
settles into a battle stance. As the first charging ores
reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his
mouth, engulfing his foes.
Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad
halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and
emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a
stone's throw away. She slides her blade free of its clothwrapped scabbard and peers through the open window
at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.
Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their
ability to magically harness the energy that flows in
their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display
of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability
and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does. `], ['Paladin', `Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite
the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally
wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands,
the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
with amazement.
A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak
making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches
an ore war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently,
he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two
ores are dead before they even realize he is there.
Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again
at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its
hideous darkness.
Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.
Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey
beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful
bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior
into a blessed champion. `], ['Ranger', `Rough and wild looking,
a human stalks alone
through the shadows of
trees, hunting the ores he
knows are planning a raid
on a nearby farm. Clutching
a shortsword in each hand,
he becomes a whirlwind of
steel, cutting down one enemy
after another.
After tumbling away from a cone of
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws
back her bow to loose an arrow at the white
dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates
from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the
dragon's thick scales.
Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his
side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to
the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to
distract the creature while he readies his bow.
Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the
hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the
terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of
trackless forests and across wide and empty plains,
rangers keep their unending watch. `], ['Rogue', `Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfiing creeps
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the
lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into
the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick
the door open.
A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
their target-a notorious slaver-passes the alleyway,
the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,
and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can
make a sound.
Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers
and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt.
In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is
open, and she and her companions are free to make
their escape.
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes'
vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
They have a knack for finding the solution to just about
any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and
versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful
adventuring party`], ['Sorcerer', `Golden eyes flashing, a human
stretches out her hand and unleashes
the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes,
leathery wings spread from her back and
she takes to the air.
Long hair whipped by a conjured wind,
a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off
the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him,
through him, and out from him in a mighty blast
of lightning.
Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfiing points a
finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her
wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.
Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred
upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly
influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces.
One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any
more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one
chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.`], ['Warlock', `With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young
elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical
charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace
sentinel to his will.
As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened
human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron,
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling
chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a
distant world.
Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power. `], ['Wizard', `Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the
battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a
tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
plane beyond.
Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.
Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spells change one substance into another, call meteors
down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.`]]
