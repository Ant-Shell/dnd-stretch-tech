# D&D Character Generator

## Introduction
  - This project was an excercise in exploring, understanding, and implementing TypeScript.
  - We chose to make a D&D Random Character Generator.
  - When the user first comes to the app, they will see the Character Creation page.
  - There, the user can fill out the required input fields and submit their new character to the party.
  - Alternatively, the user can choose to randomize their character or clear all inputs.
  - The user can delete individual characters from the party or choose to delete the whole party.
  - The user can also navigate to the Monster Manual, where they can explore a list of "Monsters" and see the monster's details and statistics.
